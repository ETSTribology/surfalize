- Remove binning from area material ratio curve. Instead sort all height values in descending order and calculate the
  cumsum of the index for the material ratio (x-axis). This might fix the deviations from the MountainsMap values for
  the functional parameters. However, this will require a reimplementation of the code in Surface.functional_parameters

- Implement the use of keyword arguments for parameter calculations using the Batch class

- Implement export of images in plotting functions as well as in the Batch class
