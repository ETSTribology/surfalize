v0.3.0:
- Removed underscore from Surface._data, ._step_x, ._step_y, ._width_um, ._height_um since they are supposed to be
  public attributes
- Fixed bug in Surface.zoom
- Reworked Batch processing: now implements lazy loading and dispatch to multiple processes for faster load time
- Operations and Parameters now are constructured as a pipeline on the Batch object, with the actual execution only
  taking place once Batch.execute is called
- Dataframe is now constructed after all processing is completed, which reduces complexity
- Added keyword argument for saving dataframe to excel upon completion of Batch.execute
- Additional data is now loaded directly when initializing Batch object and raises ValueError if column with name file
  doesn't exist
- Updated readme with examples for batch processing
- Added cropping method to Surface
- Fixed bug in plotting of depth analysis
- Added thresholding method based on material ratio to Surface
- Added outlier removal method based on sigma criterion
- Added support for operation on data which contains non-measured points to thresholding and outlier removal methods

- tqdm is now a non-optional dependency
v0.2.0:
- Added Sdq parameter -> tested against LeicaMap
- Removed width_um and height_um as initialization parameters for Surface, since they are redundant
- Added lru_cache to some functions to save computation time
- Added cache clearing mechanism as well as recalculation of width_um and height_um upon inplace modification of data
- Replaced default method for calculation of surface area with the one proposed by ISO 25178-2. The method used by
  Gwyddion is now available by keyword argument. Sdr values now match the values computed by MountainsMap and its
  derivative software packages.
- Added correct tests for ISO Sdr values
- Added Smr(c), Smc(mr) and Sxp to the functional parameters
- Moved functional parameter calculation to new class AbbottFirestoneCurve
- Added functional volume parameters Vmp, Vmc, Vvv, Vvc
- Added tests for functional volume parameters
- Added Fourier transform plotting method to Surface
- Fixed a bug with surface area calculation in the Cython code that would result in negative Sdr for some edgecases
- Added autocorrelation function and the derived spatial parameters Sal and Str
- Added tests for spatial parameters
- Restructuring of modules: Profile, AbbottFirestoneCurve, AutocorrelationFunction now in speparate modules
- Fixed filtering method: Now filters at the correct frequencies in all axes. Added note in docstring that warns about
  the side effects of zeroing bins
v0.1.0:
- Added option to Batch to supply additional parameters associated with each file that can be merged into the
  computed parameters
- Fixed bug where Surface.rotate() would leave a border of nan values
- Fixed bug in profile averaging
- Fixed calculation of Surface._get_fourier_peak_dx_dy(), now returns correct angles with correct sign
- Fixed Surface.orientation(), now considers edgecases where either dy or dx are 0
- Added calculation of areal material ratio curve
- Fixed Abbott-Firestone curve display
- Added calculation fundament for functional parameters
- Added some functional parameters: Sk, Spk, Svk, Smr1, Smr2
- Added utils module with some helper functions
- Fixed bug in depth calculation due to renaming of sinusoid function
- Added aspect ratio parameter to Surface
- Added tests for roughness parameters
- Added script to generate tests for roughness parameters for a set of example surfaces
