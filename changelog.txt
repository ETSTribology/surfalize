v0.2.0:
- Added Sdq parameter -> tested against LeicaMap
- Removed width_um and height_um as initialization parameters for Surface, since they are redundant
- Added lru_cache to some functions to save computation time
- Added cache clearing mechanism as well as recalculation of width_um and height_um upon inplace modification of data
v0.1.0:
- Added option to Batch to supply additional parameters associated with each file that can be merged into the
  computed parameters
- Fixed bug where Surface.rotate() would leave a border of nan values
- Fixed bug in profile averaging
- Fixed calculation of Surface._get_fourier_peak_dx_dy(), now returns correct angles with correct sign
- Fixed Surface.orientation(), now considers edgecases where either dy or dx are 0
- Added calculation of areal material ratio curve
- Fixed Abbott-Firestone curve display
- Added calculation fundament for functional parameters
- Added some functional parameters: Sk, Spk, Svk, Smr1, Smr2
- Added utils module with some helper functions
- Fixed bug in depth calculation due to renaming of sinusoid function
- Added aspect ratio parameter to Surface
- Added tests for roughness parameters
- Added script to generate tests for roughness parameters for a set of example surfaces
