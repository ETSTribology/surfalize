- Remove binning from area material ratio curve. Instead sort all height values in descending order and calculate the
  cumsum of the index for the material ratio (x-axis). This might fix the deviations from the MountainsMap values for
  the functional parameters. However, this will require a reimplementation of the code in Surface.functional_parameters

- Implement export of images in plotting functions as well as in the Batch class

- Consider surface orientation in structure depth calculation

- Omit profiles from structure depth calculation that have a large deviation from the spatial period
